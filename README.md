# IoT Security Simulator
This program meant to demonstrate a simple security implementation that can be applied to most IoT devices and their network. The program provides an interface for manipulating a network, a connected IoT device, and an attacker/malicious device which the simulation user can utilize to test the overall security of the system.
This is a command line simulation and requires a C++ compiler to build and run.

## Setup
*** Version 1.0.0 ***

To get a local repo of the project, run:
git clone https://github.com/itseullman/cns-group-7.git

To build the simulation, compile the following files with a C++ compiler:
g++ simulation.cpp device.cpp

Or:
clang++ simulation.cpp device.cpp

Finally, to start running the simulation, simply run the resulting executable, ie:
./a.out
